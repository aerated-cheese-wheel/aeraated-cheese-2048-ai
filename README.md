Method 1: Using a Python IDE
Many Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have built-in package managers that allow you to install packages without using the terminal. Here are a few examples:

PyCharm: Go to File > Settings > Project: [your project name] > Python Interpreter. Click the + button at the bottom left corner of the window, search for the package you want to install, and click Install Package.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + P (Mac). Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select the interpreter you want to use. Then, open the Command Palette again and type "Terminal: Create New Terminal". In the new terminal, type python -m pip install pygame to install the package.
Spyder: Go to Tools > Preferences > Python interpreter > Manage packages. Search for the package you want to install and click Install.
Method 2: Using a Package Manager GUI
Some package managers have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow you to install packages without using the terminal. Here are a few examples:

pipgui: pipgui is a GUI for pip that allows you to install packages without using the terminal. You can download the installer from the pipgui GitHub page.
PyPI: PyPI is the official Python package repository. You can search for packages on the PyPI website and download the installer for the package you want to install.
Method 3: Using a Python Package Installer
Some Python package installers allow you to install packages without using the terminal. Here are a few examples:

pip-win: pip-win is a package installer for Windows that allows you to install packages without using the terminal. You can download the installer from the pip-win GitHub page.
python -m pip: You can use the python -m pip command to install packages without using the terminal. For example, to install the pygame package, you can use the following command: python -m pip install pygame
Troubleshooting PowerShell Issues
If PowerShell doesn't recognize the pip install command, it's likely because the Python executable directory is not in your system's PATH environment variable. Here are a few solutions:

Add the Python executable directory to the PATH environment variable: Right-click on the Start button and select System. Click on Advanced system settings and then click on Environment Variables. Under System Variables, scroll down and find the Path variable, then click Edit. Click New and enter the path to the Python executable directory (e.g., C:\Python39\bin).
Use the full path to the pip executable: Instead of using the pip install command, try using the full path to the pip executable. For example: C:\Python39\Scripts\pip.exe install pygame
Use the python -m pip command: As mentioned earlier, you can use the python -m pip command to install packages without using the terminal. For example: python -m pip install pygame`
